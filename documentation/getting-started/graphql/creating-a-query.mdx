## Connecting to a GraphQL server

Switch to the GraphQL platform on Hoppscotch and connect to the below GraphQL server.

```
https://echo.hoppscotch.io/graphql
```

Once a successful connection has been made, you can view both **documentation** and the **schema** using Hoppscotch.

It is important to explore the schema to understand the different **queries, mutations, types, and subscriptions** that are offered by the endpoint.

## Running the query

You can execute queries to retrieve data from the GraphQL server by following these steps:

- Open the **Documentation** panel to explore the available queries for the endpoint.
- Click on `query` under **Root Types** to view the listed query fields.
- Click the **"+"** button next to a query field to add it to the Query editor with a structured template.
- Expand the query by clicking on it, then use the **"+"** button to add specific fields, arguments, or filters.
- Customize the query as needed by modifying fields, adding arguments, or setting variables directly in the Query editor.

## Fetching Countries Data

Let's explore a sample query using the Countries GraphQL API.

1. Open Hoppscotch, switch to the [GraphQL client](https://hoppscotch.io/graphql) and connect to the endpoint below:

    ```
    https://countries.trevorblades.com/graphql
    ```

2. Explore the schema and documentation to understand more about the endpoint.
3. Select the `countries` query, cherry-pick the fields, and add a filter to return results where the `name` field is equal to **"Germany"**.

    ```graphql
    {
      countries (filter: {name: {eq: "Germany"}}) {
        name
        code
        capital
        emoji
        currencies
      }
    }
    ```

4. Click on the run button to execute the query.
5. The query will return the following response.

    ```json
    {
      "data": {
        "countries": [
          {
            "name": "Germany",
            "code": "DE",
            "capital": "Berlin",
            "emoji": "ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª",
            "currencies": [
              "EUR"
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    ```
